The files `smoforC.m` and `smofor2.m` are simulations for Method I targeting single and multiple objects, respectively.  
`smoforCanother.m` and `smofor2another.m` are simulations for Method II, also for single and multiple objects respectively.  
The file `usesedumi_all.m` contains the code for solving feasible parameters for the second-order sliding mode differentiator in Method I.  
`usesedumi_another.m` is the code for determining feasible parameters for the second-order sliding mode differentiator in Method II.  
`usesedumi_first.m` contains the code for finding feasible parameters for the first-order sliding mode differentiator in Method I.
